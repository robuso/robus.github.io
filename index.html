		<p>The first thing we can do is see where we are in the overall filesystem. To do this we can type in the
			command <code>pwd</code> (print working directory). After you press <kbd>Enter</kbd> you should see the full
			path to
			your current directory location. For me it looks like this <code>/Users/orobus</code>. </p>


		<p>Using a computer's "command line" <em>allows</em> you to type instructions to the computer which then interprets and
			executes whatever you told it to do. There are several reasons to use the command line. First, and most
			pragmatically, some software simply doesn't have a GUI component, and so the only way to use it is through
			the command line. Second, sometimes using a program through the command line is faster, simpler, or
			otherwise easier to use than graphical workflows, even if they do exist. For Git, a GUI does exist, but I am
			unfamiliar with it, and in any case, learning to use the command line is an extremely useful skill to have.
		</p>


		<p>Notice that the first '<code>/</code>' is important! That first slash is the "name" of the root directory on
			your
			computer. Every file in your computer can be referenced by specifying a path starting with that root folder.
			Our current working directory (and the one Terminal default opens in) is called our "home directory".
		</p>


		<p>This is a special directory, and everything contained in it is "owned" by you (as opposed to the OS itself,
			or other users on your computer). What does that mean exactly? Well, the best way to see is by looking at
			what this directory contains.
