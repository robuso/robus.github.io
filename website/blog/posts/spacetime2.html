  <h1>World-lines and Space-times</h1>
  <a href="/website/blog/posts/spacetime1.html" style="color: rgb(22, 78, 128);">(For the first part in this series, you can go here)</a>
  <p> In the previous post we claimed that the
    basic (‘primitive’) elements of our theory (SR) are events. Events are
    ‘happenings’, like the bang from a firecracker—things that occur at a
    particular place in both space and time. In this post we’ll look at how
    to represent events graphically, so that we can use our geometric
    intuition to think about the relations between them (which, remember, is
    what SR is all about).</p>
  <p>Recall that we spoke of events as having spatial and temporal
    coordinates. A meeting might be at 3rd and Pine (your x and y
    coordinates), on the fourth floor (your z coordinate), at 4pm (your t
    coordinate). How would we represent this graphically? We can represent
    three spatial coordinates with a 3D model (perhaps a scale model of
    downtown), but how would we add in the fourth? Not without difficulty!
    We could, instead, decide to ‘suppress’ one of the spatial dimensions
    (maybe the z axis) and represent the movement of time in this dimension.
    To make things maximally simple, for our discussion we are going to
    suppress two of the spatial dimensions, so that we’re left with exactly
    one spatial dimension (as a convention we’ll choose the x axis), and one
    temporal dimension (which we’ll place on the vertical axis).</p>
  <p>So, our representation of space-time will look like figure 1. The
    area inside the box will be our representation, and I’ve drawn in the
    axes for time and space. I’ll leave these out in the future, but don’t
    forget they’re there.</p>

  <p>Now, given this space-time, we can mark an event by a point. Two
    events will have a spatial and temporal distance between them, which we
    can call the change in x and the change in t (abbreviated ∆x and ∆t),
    see figure 2.</p>

  <p>What are these points? Remember, they are not persistent objects, but
    events: ephemeral ‘happenings’. What about persistent objects? The way
    we’ll think of them are as series of events linked together. Suppose we
    had a sequence of events, all lined up, between events a and b, like in
    figure 3.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../media/fig3.png" alt="figure 3" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">figure 3</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>If these events became spaced so close together so that at any
    spatial coordinate there was an event at the appropriate temporal
    coordinate (and vice-versa), then we could safely say that these events
    represented an object (like a baseball, or perhaps a person). In figure
    4 we represent an object moving (in both time and space!).</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../media/fig4.png" alt="figure 4" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">figure 4</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In fact, not only does this line represent an object moving, it can
    tell us a lot about that motion. Suppose that ∆x = 2 meters, and ∆t = 4
    seconds. The velocity of an object is just its change in position
    divided by the change in time, and so we can calculate the velocity for
    this object: ∆x/∆t = 0.5 m/s! In general, the slope of any straight line
    in our representation will encode the velocity of the object represented
    by that line. (And, by extension, the tangent to any curve will encode
    the instantaneous velocity of the object. Pop quiz: if a straight line
    represents an object with a constant velocity, what does a curved line
    represent?)</p>
  <p>The simplest case to consider is an object represented by a straight
    vertical line. Take me for example. Sitting here, slumped in my chair,
    you can think of me as a continuous series of events. But as I write
    this, I’m not moving in space—I’m just here, sedentary, not doing
    anything. Time keeps ticking by, so for each event-part of me, it has a
    different temporal coordinate. Take any two different events consisting
    of me sitting here and measure the ∆x and ∆t. Whatever the change in
    time, the change in position is zero, and so 0/∆t = 0 m/s.</p>
  <p>The other limit case would be a horizontal line. What does this
    represent? We’ll talk about the answer in the next post.</p>
  <p>That’s all for now! Again, to recap, we represent events in
    space-time as points in our coordinate system. Continuous series of
    events represent an object (I’m just a series of ‘me’-‘happenings’!).
    Finally, the slope of that series of events represents the velocity of
    the object traveling through space.</p>
  <p>We now have our complete representation. Next time we’ll look at
    different physical interpretations in this model, comparing two
    non-relativistic theories: aristotelian and galilean space-times.</p>
