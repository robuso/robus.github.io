<p>In the previous post we claimed that the basic (‘primitive’) elements
of our theory (SR) are events. Events are ‘happenings’, like the bang
from a firecracker—things that occur at a particular place in both space
and time. In this post we’ll look at how to represent events
graphically, so that we can use our geometric intuition to think about
the relations between them (which, remember, is what SR is all
about).</p>
<p>Recall that we spoke of events as having spatial and temporal
coordinates. A meeting might be at <em>3rd</em> and <em>Pine</em> (your
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates, respectively), on the <em>fourth
floor</em> (your <em>z</em> coordinate), at <em>4pm</em> (your
<em>t</em> coordinate). How would we represent this graphically? We can
represent three spatial coordinates with a 3D model (perhaps a scale
model of downtown), but how would we add in the fourth? Not without
difficulty! We could, instead, decide to ‘suppress’ one of the spatial
dimensions (maybe the z axis) and represent movement along the temporal
axis on this dimension. The representation would then look like layering
‘slices’ of a two dimensional world, stacking the next moment on top of
the last.</p>

<p>To make things maximally simple, for our discussion we are going to
suppress <em>two</em> of the spatial dimensions, so that we’re left with
exactly one spatial dimension (as a convention we’ll choose the
<em>x</em>, or horizontal, axis), and one temporal dimension (which
we’ll place on the vertical axis).</p>
<p>So, our representation of space-time will look like figure 1. The
area inside the box will be our representation, and I’ve drawn in the
axes for time and space. I’ll leave these out in the future, but don’t
forget they’re there.</p>

<p>Now, given this space-time, we can mark an event by a point. Two
events will have a spatial and temporal distance between them, which we
can call the change in <em>x</em> and the change in <em>t</em>
(abbreviated ∆<em>x</em> and ∆<em>t</em>), see figure 2.</p>

<p>What are these points? Remember, they are not persistent objects, but
events: ephemeral and instantaneous ‘happenings’. What about persistent
objects? The way we’ll think of them are as series of events linked
together. Suppose we had a sequence of events, all lined up, between
events a and b, like in figure 3.</p>
<p>If these events became spaced so close together so that at any
spatial coordinate there was an event at the appropriate temporal
coordinate (and vice-versa), then we could safely say that these events
represented an object (like a baseball, or perhaps a person). In figure
4 we represent an object moving (in both time and space!).</p>
<p>In fact, not only does this line represent an object moving, it can
tell us a lot about that motion. Suppose that ∆x = 2 meters, and ∆t = 4
seconds. The velocity of an object is just its change in position
divided by the change in time, and so we can calculate the velocity for
this object: ∆x/∆t = 0.5 m/s! In general, the slope of any straight line
in our representation will encode the velocity of the object represented
by that line. (And, by extension, the tangent to any curve will encode
the instantaneous velocity of the object. Pop quiz: if a straight line
represents an object with a constant velocity, what does a curved line
represent?)</p>
<p>The simplest case to consider is an object represented by a straight
vertical line. Take me for example. Sitting here, slumped in my chair,
you can think of me as a continuous series of events. But as I write
this, I’m not moving in space—I’m just here, sedentary, not doing
anything. Time keeps ticking by, so for each event-part of me, it has a
different temporal coordinate. Take any two different events consisting
of me sitting here and measure the ∆x and ∆t. Whatever the change in
time, the change in position is zero, and so 0/∆t = 0 m/s.</p>
<p>The other limit case would be a horizontal line. What does this
represent? We’ll talk about the answer in the next post.</p>
<p>That’s all for now! Again, to recap, we represent events in
space-time as points in our coordinate system. Continuous series of
events represent an object (I’m just a series of ‘me’-‘happenings’!).
Finally, the slope of that series of events represents the velocity of
the object traveling through space.</p>
<p>We now have our complete representation. Next time we’ll look at
different physical interpretations in this model, comparing two
non-relativistic theories: aristotelian and galilean space-times.</p>
