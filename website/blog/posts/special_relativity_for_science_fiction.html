<p>I love science fiction, and I love the idea of space travel and space
exploration. But as I age my ability to suspend disbelief declines, and
I lose ever more patience with unrealistic depictions of traversing the
genuinely incomprehensible distances that space travel requires.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be like this! I’m happy to suspend disbelief
if some attempt has been made to reckon with the consequences of a
fictional FTL solution. This essay is an attempt to, for myself, get
clear on all the various aspects of Special Relativity one must grapple
with in order to have a happily plausible FTL. If, in the process, we
verge into philosophical territory and find ourselves meditating on the
intersection of epistemology, metaphysics, the philosophy of science,
and the philosophy of language, well, that’s my fault.</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">1 The Basics</h2>
<p>Special Relativity is a theory of how to measure distances between
events. There are a couple of things to say about this already—first, to
say that it is a theory is to simply say that it is a mathematical model
(or rather a set of such models) that have (a) specific
<em>correlates</em> to the experienced world, and (b) a
<em>procedure</em> for how to take those correlates and produce
<em>results</em> that are themselves possibly correlated to our
experience in the appropriate ways. While this may not be a usual way to
speak of a scientific theory, we can see it maps on to more typical
accounts—the correlates are typically spoken about as ‘initial’ or
‘boundary’ conditions for a theory, while the procedure is more or less
the collection of ‘laws’ and the constellation of practices and norms
around their application and calculation. Finally, the results of
operating on the correlates via the procedure are what are usually
understood as ‘predictions’. So, in more familiar language, we might
gloss the notion of a scientific theory as “The application of natural
laws on initial conditions to produce predictions.”</p>
<p>Now, just to be clear, <em>this is not how science works, nor is it
an accurate picture of how scientists see themselves</em>. Indeed, it
obviously falls short in many sciences where initial conditions, laws,
and predictions are not and clearly defined as they are
in—say—mathematical physics. My point in characterizing Special
Relativity (SR) this way is to emphasize what it looks like ‘from the
outside’ as it were. As we get deeper into learning about SR, it will
become easier and easier to think and speak as if we were thinking and
speaking about the world, when we are in fact speaking about a theory
which <em>cannot</em> be an adequate description of reality, simply
because it is not an adequate description of our experience (here
philosophers would say the theory is not ‘empirically adequate’).
Nevertheless, it’s still a worthwhile theory to study, since it
<em>does</em> serve as an incredibly adequate theory for our experiences
within a certain domain.</p>
<p>As I said above, SR is a theory about how to measure distances
between events. Now that I’ve gotten off my high-horse about what a
theory is, let’s look at the other parts of this statement. In
particular, what stands in most need of explanation is what we mean by
‘distance’ and ‘event’. You may have heard that SR isn’t about space and
time, but rather <em>spacetime</em>. And that’s not wrong—Einstein and
others before him recognized that measurements of distance, especially
in the realm of the physical sciences, could not afford to decouple the
notions of spatial and temporal distance. This becomes clearest when
attempting to measure things which are either very big, or moving very
quickly. But an important consequence of this was the recognition that
we cannot measure distances between objects, or ‘things’, but instead
must measure <em>events</em>. ‘Event’ is a pedestrian word that has been
elevated to a privileged status in SR and the physical sciences more
generally. An event for SR (and for us) is analogous to a point in
Euclidean geometry—a dimensionless geometric primitive. But with SR
being specified in a 4-dimensional vector space, one of whose dimensions
is ‘time’, the basic idea of a point was extended to the notion of a
dimensionless, instantaneous, ‘happening’. Thus, just like <span
class="math inline">ℝ<sup>2</sup></span> can be thought of as
constructed out of the points <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> <span class="math inline">∈</span>
{<span class="math inline">ℝ × ℝ</span>}, the spacetime of SR is
constructed out of the union of all ‘events’.</p>
