<p>[Note: This article was originally written in October 2015, when I
was in grad school. I’ve updated and (hopefully) improved it. For the
second part, you can <a href="spacetime2.html">go here</a>]</p>
<h1 id="section">0</h1>
<p>This post begins a series of short articles I want to write about
special relativity and its relevance to some philosophical issues I’ve
been mulling over. Why am I doing this? Mostly because I think it’s
interesting, and because some of the most radical results of special
relativity are as simple as understanding geometry (actually simpler
than some geometry). I think a lot of people hear ‘relativity’ and
suppose it’s too complicated or advanced to be understood without
dedicated schooling. But relativity can be (and should be) understood by
anyone! It also provides a nice entrance into some interesting and
difficult philosophical questions which you may care about, even if you
didn’t realize it.</p>
<p>(There’s one other reason for writing this series, and that’s because
its content takes up a significant portion of the first chapter of my
dissertation, which I’m sure you don’t find interesting, but is
important to me.)</p>
<p>Where to begin? This post is going to be about the basic conventions
for the model we’re going to use. In fact, it’s only going to be about a
part of the background for explaining the theory. We’ll get to the rest
in the later posts.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">1</h1>
<p>Special relativity (henceforth ‘SR’) is a theory about space and
time, or really, space-time. That is, it’s a theory about the relations
of things to one another in space-time. This might sound gnomic and
obscure, but it’s really very simple. We all possess a natural
understanding of how things are related to one another in space: “The
apple is to the left of the orange;” “The Fiat is behind the Tesla,”
“Those jerks live above me.”</p>
<p>We also all possess a natural understanding of how things are related
to one another in time: “Episode IV was released before Episode I;” “I
have an earlier appointment than you;” “She is always late for
dinners.”</p>
<p>Given two things, I bet you could do a pretty good job telling me how
they were related in space or time. Let’s try it out:</p>
<p>Q1: Where is the Eiffel Tower compared to the Statue of Liberty? A:
It is <em>east of</em> the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>Q2: When did the (American) Civil War happen compared to the
(American) Revolutionary War? A: The Civil War <em>happened after</em>
the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>See? Not too difficult. Notice, however, that the questions were
implicitly ‘spatial’ (Q1) and ‘temporal’ (Q2). It would have been weird
for me to ask ‘<em>When</em> is the Eiffel Tower related to the Statue
of Liberty?’ There doesn’t seem to be a coherent answer. And likewise,
there doesn’t seem to be a coherent answer to how the two wars are
related in space. What does it mean, then, when we say that SR is a
theory about space-time?</p>
<p>What we need to do is introduce a new concept. It will look like an
ordinary concept with which you’re intimately familiar, but we’ll see
that it will take on a technical significance as well. This is the
concept of an <em>event</em>. An event is a ‘happening’—a thing that
occurs in a place, at a time. Just as we might give a physical object
(such as the Space Needle) coordinates in space (e.g. <a
href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NuSSYMRSwRTq9CKN6">47.6204° N, 122.3491°
W</a> [thanks Google!]), we give an event coordinates in space-time.
Thus, the event consisting of the Space Needle’s construction is located
at the spatial coordinates listed above, plus a time coordinate (1,962
years measured from a ‘zero’ starting point).</p>
<p>If you have an appointment in a certain location and at a certain
time, most likely you are navigating by means of space-time coordinates:
3rd and Pine, 4th floor, 2:00pm. The meeting is an event in space (given
by the streets and floor of the building) and time (given by the
hour).</p>
<p>Ok, so I’ve spent an undue amount of time explaining something that
you already understand—events. The reason I do this is because for SR,
events are <em>primitive</em>, that is, they are the basic ‘things’. The
physical object constituting the Space Needle, the Eiffel Tower, or the
Statue of Liberty is to be understood as a continuous series of events
happening at various times. You and I are to be understood as series of
events strung together across space and time—space-time. As I walk
across the street, this series of events happens to take on different
spatial coordinates at different times, while as I write this, sitting
still, the series of events which constitute me have the same spatial
coordinates at different times.</p>
<p>Now, hopefully we have a clearer idea of what it means to say that SR
is a theory about the relations of things to one another in space-time.
What I really mean is that it is about the relations between events.
What is novel about SR is that it tells us that in some circumstances,
the relations between events are not fixed, and that the relations might
depend on the motion of the observer!</p>
<p>Ok! That’s all for now. To review, we gave a very general definition
of what SR is (a theory about how things are related in space-time),
talked a little about relations between things is both space and time
(‘to the left of’, ‘earlier than’), and introduced the notion of
events—things which have spatial and temporal coordinates. Finally, we
tied up the whole ball of string by refining our definition of SR: a
theory of how events are related in space-time.</p>
<p>Next time: We’ll look at (and understand how to interpret) the
geometrical representation we’ll be using to explore SR, as well as
start thinking about why we might want a theory of how events are
related in space-time. (More pictures in the next post too)</p>
